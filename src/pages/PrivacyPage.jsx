      content: `We collect information you provide directly to us and information we collect automatically when you use the Services.\n\n**Information You Provide:**
* **Account Information:** When you register directly with our service (if applicable), we collect your name and email address. If password-based login is offered, your password is collected but stored only in a securely hashed format, never directly. We may also collect your phone number if you provide it.
* **Subscription & Payment Information:** Our Free plan does not require any payment information. When you subscribe to a paid plan, we collect information necessary to process your payment (such as billing details) through our third-party payment processor (e.g., Midtrans). We do not directly store your full credit card details.
* **YouTube Account Information:** When you connect your YouTube accounts via Google OAuth, we receive information associated with those accounts, such as channel IDs, channel names, profile pictures, and access tokens (stored securely encrypted) necessary to perform actions on your behalf (like uploading videos). This process does not give us access to your Google account password.
* **Video Metadata:** Information you provide for video uploads, such as titles, descriptions, tags, thumbnails, and scheduling details, stored in templates or during the upload process.
* **Support Communications:** Information you provide when you contact us for support via email, AI Chat, or Live Chat, including the content of your messages and any attachments (like images in Live Chat).\n
**Information We Collect Automatically:**
* **Usage Information:** Details about how you interact with the Services, such as features used, actions taken, time spent, and error logs.
* **Device and Connection Information:** Your IP address, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, and general location information derived from your IP address.
* **Cookies and Similar Technologies:** We use cookies (small text files stored on your device) and similar technologies to operate and improve the Services, authenticate users, remember preferences, and analyze usage. See the "Cookies" section for more details.`

• **Password Security:** When using email/password authentication, passwords are never stored directly. Instead, they are securely hashed using industry-standard hashing algorithms designed for password protection.
• **OAuth Security:** When connecting YouTube accounts, we never receive or store your Google password. The authentication process happens directly with Google.
• **Token Encryption:** YouTube API access tokens are encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption with proper initialization vectors and authentication tags before being stored in our database.
• **Transport Layer Security:** All communications with our service use SSL/TLS encryption (HTTPS).
• **Rate Limiting:** We employ rate limiting to protect against brute force login attempts and other potential security threats.
• **Input Validation:** We validate all user inputs to help protect against common web vulnerabilities.

However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.`
